## 🐍 Snakes & Ladders Simulation (Python)

This project is a Python implementation and simulation of the classic Snakes and Ladders game.
It includes game logic, player movement, snakes and ladders behavior, and a simple application entry point.
The project is structured in a modular way so that the game logic, simulation, and execution are clearly separated.


## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
├── app.py               # Main entry point of the application
├── game_sim.py          # Game simulation logic
├── snake.py             # Snake-related logic / definitions
├── snakes_n_ladders.py  # Core Snakes & Ladders game implementation
├── Test.py              # Test or experimentation script
├── static/              # Static assets (if needed later)
├── __pycache__/         # Python bytecode cache (auto-generated)
```

## 🚀 Features
	•	🎲 Dice-based movement
	•	🐍 Snakes that move players backward
	•	🪜 Ladders that move players forward
	•	👥 Support for multiple players
	•	🔁 Game simulation logic separated from core rules
	•	🧪 Test script for quick experimentation

## ▶️ How to Run

### 🛠️ Requirements
- Python **3.8 or higher**

### 🛠️ Installation

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

Clone the repository and run:

```bash
python app.py
```

Run a simulation directly:

```bash
python game_sim.py
```

Run tests or experiments:
```bash
python Test.py
```

## 🧩 File Overview

### snakes_n_ladders.py
	•	Core game rules
	•	Board setup
	•	Player movement logic
	•	Snakes and ladders behavior

### snake.py
	•	Helper logic related to snakes (and possibly ladders)

### game_sim.py
	•	Simulates one or multiple full games
	•	Useful for statistics or AI experiments

### app.py
	•	Entry point
	•	Ties everything together and starts the game

### Test.py
	•	Used for quick testing, debugging, or experimenting with game logic.

## 📌 Notes

	•	The __pycache__ folder is auto-generated by Python and can be safely ignored.
	•	The static/ folder is included for future extensions (e.g. UI, images, or web version).

## 💡 Possible Extensions

	•	🎮 GUI (e.g. with Pygame or Tkinter)
	•	🌐 Web version (Flask / FastAPI)
	•	🤖 AI players & strategy comparison
	•	📊 Game statistics and visualizations
